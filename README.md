# BMI-CALCULATOR-USING-STREAMLIT
To run this code, make sure you have Streamlit installed (pip install streamlit) and save the code in a file with a .py extension (e.g., bmi_calculator.py). Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the following command: streamlit run bmi_calculator.py. This will launch a web application where you can interact with the controls and see the calculated BMI.
